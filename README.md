# Ed&Dragons Initiative Tracker
When running combat in person, I always find I'm scrambling for different bits of information - trying to reconcile multiple browser tabs with hastily scribbled notes on bits of loose paper. An issue I have with most initiative trackers is they are either too basic, or far too complicated to quickly set up a combat - even if the tracker can manage all the datasheets I find this gets clunky really fast. One such feature that I haven't seen on many is a shared initiative option for multiple creatures of the same type, with the ability to individually track health.

I give you the DM's new best friend - a stylish initiative tracker capable of tracking enemies of different types, such as a "minion" which can have multiple health trackers with a shared initiative value and the "boss" who has legendary action tracking built in. The tracker has a log/history system too so any mistakes realised down the line can be easily reversed, taking the load off the weary DM's mind. All the information is stored in the browsers 'local storage' so it will be retained between sessions, and different groups of enemies/players can be saved and restored at any time.

A number of handy features ahve been baked in, such as temporary modifiers for AC values and tracking different environment effects with as many counters as you can fit on the screen (spoilers it's not as many as you'd think - but I'm not going to stop you from squeezing them on there).

Play around with the beta version here on github pages: https://edpacca.github.io/ednd-initiative/.
